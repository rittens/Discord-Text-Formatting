# Discord-Text-Formatting
Just a simple guide for discord text formatting.


## Bold Text
To bold text, you will need to use two asterisks/stars in front of the text you want to bold and after the text.

`This ia a test sentence, **and everything after first comma is in bold.**`

## Italicize Text
For italicizing text we use 1 star instead of 2.

`This ia a test sentence, *and everything after first comma is italicized*`

## Bold Italicized
We can even combine these two, lets try. This time use 3 stars.

`This ia a test sentence, ***and everything after first comma is italicized and in bold***`

## Underline Text
Underlining is easy, all you need to use are underline symbols.

`This ia a test sentence, __and everything after first comma is underlined__`

## Strikethrough Text
These symbols are weird to find, but there you go lol.

`This ia a test sentence, ~~and everything after first comma is crossed out~~`

You can combine those and make your text look all funky, just give it a test yourself.

# Single Line Code Block
To create a single line code block in discord, you need to use the ‘tick’ or ‘backtick’.

```his is an example```

**Very important text here**
```
1) text here
2) another text here
3) yet another text line
4) texty text
5) this is just template post
6) text.```
